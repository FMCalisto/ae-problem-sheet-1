\section*{Question 1}

a) A representative enterprise architecture should be defined \cite{eaFundamentals} by three layers:

- Business: it offers services to customers through products, where the services are realized by business processes that use the informational entities of the organization and run by business actors.

- Application: supports the level of business with application services realized in application components.

- Technological: provides infrastructure services, like processing, storage and communication, to the application layer and it is where also the services are realized by software, machines and computer devices.
